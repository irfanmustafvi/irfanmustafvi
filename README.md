## 🚀 About Me

I am passionate about the transformative power of Linux, DevOps, and cloud technologies. With a background in system administration, I’m on a journey to master cloud infrastructure, automation, and containerization. On my GitHub, easy to find projects where I explore automation, AWS, CI/CD, and scripting to tackle real-world challenges in system management and development.

💡 Currently Exploring: AWS, Docker, and Python to deepen my DevOps toolkit. I’m passionate about sharing knowledge and contributing to open-source projects that make tech accessible and efficient.
